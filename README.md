# Random-Password-Generator-in-Python
In this code, we use the random module to generate random characters for the password. We combine string.ascii_letters, string.digits, and string.punctuation to get a set of characters that include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and punctuation marks.

The generate_password function takes a length parameter, which specifies the desired length of the password. It then uses a loop to select random characters from the combined set of characters and join them together into a string.

Finally, the program prompts the user to enter the length of the password, generates a password of the specified length using the generate_password function, and prints the generated password to the console.
